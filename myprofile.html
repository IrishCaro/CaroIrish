        <br>
        I'm Irish Joy A. Caro. I'm
        18 years old and my birthday is on July 26, 2005. I currently live in Sitio Bulalo, Balite, Calapan City. I'm  a college student, studying at the City College of Calapan with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Systems.
          My parents name is Mary Jane A. Caro, my mother, and Rommar L. Caro, my father, but they got both seperated. <br><br> 
          I'm Jolly but it depends on the person that I talk or bond. My social battery is so easy to drain especially when I'm to hyper, that's why some people tend to misinterpret and think that I'm mad or something bad happened but it's really not. It is just me! <br><br>
          I'm currently in a relationship with Mr. Kyle Daryl Mizon, who I never expected to be the man of my dreams, I'm thankful that he came and help me to build myself from the past experiences that I have before.
